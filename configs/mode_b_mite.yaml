# PlantVillage Rose Edition - Mode B Mite Counting Dataset Config
# YOLOv8 dataset configuration for TSSM life stage detection

# Dataset paths (relative to project root)
path: ../data/processed/mode_b_split
train: train/images
val: val/images
test: test/images

# Number of classes
nc: 5

# Class names - Two-Spotted Spider Mite (TSSM) life stages
names:
  0: egg
  1: larva
  2: nymph
  3: adult_female
  4: adult_male

# Class descriptions for reference
# egg: Spherical, translucent to opaque eggs (~0.14mm diameter)
# larva: Six-legged stage, pale colored (~0.15mm)
# nymph: Eight-legged immature stage, developing color (~0.2-0.3mm)
# adult_female: Eight-legged, oval body, two dark spots visible (~0.4mm)
# adult_male: Eight-legged, smaller wedge-shaped body (~0.3mm)

# Training notes:
# - Use YOLOv8-Small for better small object detection
# - Recommended image size: 640x640 for higher resolution
# - SAHI sliced inference recommended for macro photos
# - Objects are very small - may need anchor box tuning
